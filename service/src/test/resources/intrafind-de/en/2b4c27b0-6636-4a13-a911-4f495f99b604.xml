NetApp storage solutions store large amounts of data in file systems. With the iFinder5 elastic, users can search documents in their file systems quicker, both full-text and related metadata. The advantages: The user no longer has to use the time-consuming, slow and resource-intensive explorer search and finds the desired information in split seconds. One of the central aspects for application in a company is the consideration of authorizations. Thanks to Secure Search, users can only access the documents they are authorized to access. The IntraFind NetApp connector, in combination with the fpolicy interface, processes large amounts of data quickly and securely. If a new document is created, deleted, changed, or authorization is changed, this change is processed directly and almost without a time lag in the iFinder. An elaborate crawling is not necessary for this. This way, the information and authorizations are always up-to-date and the search results always reflect the current status in real-time. Thanks to numerous connectors, such as Microsoft Exchange, Confluence, Microsoft SharePoint, ERP or CRM systems, the iFinder can also be easily converted into a company-wide search solution. The iFinder5 elastic thus forms the central information and knowledge repository of a company. The iFinder – tailored to the quality requirements of a customer – offers all the usual features for a professional, market-leading search solution such as faceting and filtering, preview with hit highlighting, intelligent autocomplete with typing error correction and the full range of a Boolean search. In addition, the iFinder stands out through numerous expandabilities such as semantic search and proper noun recognition. Thanks to excellent linguistics combined with deep learning, the iFinder can be expanded to an insight engine that can process natural-language (NLP) search queries. Ready to Use Solution for NetApp Customers IntraFind provides NetApp customers with the iFinder5 elastic a ready to use product based on Elasticsearch with an intuitive user interface. The software package is available either as license or subscription. Users get a flexible search solution that can either be used as a standalone solution for NetApp file services or extended to a comprehensive enterprise search solution. The iFinder can be seamlessly integrated into the existing IT infrastructure. The application is easily scalable: if the data grows, the iFinder5 elastic grows with it. The enterprise search solution is therefore suitable for small companies as well as large corporations. IntraFind provides a test package that allows you to quickly and easily test the search solution with your own documents.

With the iFinder5 elastic IntraFind offers an interesting alternative to Google Search Appliance (GSA). If you need to extend GSA in your company or you want to switch to a future-proof and stable solution, the following blog post is just right for you. Many customers have invested in GSA because of the brand name Google - and not because an appliance was required. From the perspective of Google, the situation has developed as follows: With discontinuing GSA, the last remaining non-cloud solution is removed from the portfolio. A further development of the product or the support will probably only be done half-heartedly in the future. GSA was primarily used to search on websites, in online shops and intranets - an environment in which a right-checked search is often not necessarily required If you want to replace your existing solution, IntraFind offers a modern alternative with the iFinder as virtual appliance. Installation and configuration do not take more time, the administration is straightforward and time-saving and an existing content feed architecture for the data delivery to GSA can be maintained. This is what we guarantee. We as a German company stand for data security and protection. The iFinder does not transmit sensitive data to the vendor and also provides significantly more search functionalities than GSA. We as a German company provide the best results at the top of the hit list, because we have invested a lot in our development to handle especially German-language documents optimally. This also applies to 32 additional major business languages. We do not force our customers not to go into the cloud. The iFinder can be operated in your own IT infrastructure or in the cloud. We adapt to you - and not vice versa: You do not have to act in accordance with the requirements of the vendor. Unlimited scalability, load balancing and real-time indexing guarantee that the iFinder can always grow with your needs. We use Elasticsearch as the basis of our advanced search and index solution. A combination of hardware and software does not automatically make a modern search. Search must be safe, search must be easy to administer - more than 1000 iFinder customers rely on that for many years already. But search also has to be attractive. With our autocomplete combined with semantic technologies and an understanding for the complexity of the German language, we inspire our customers with integrated typo correction and reasonable extension proposals. With this we provide the context of a query from the document contents and thus help to quickly find the one searched document or assist with exploring unknown content. In addition, all the information is right-checked in the context of the logged in user. When searching in shops for example, all set filters are applied to autocomplete as well. As you can see: all in all a real and cheaper alternative to your GSA! Our offer Have a look at the iFinder during a web session or a recorded webcast. We discuss your individual situation and create a tailor-made, individual offer. And as soon as we replaced your GSA, we also take care of the free disposal of your electronic waste. We are looking forward to your inquiry. Live Webcast May 12, 2016 Attend our live webcast &quot;You want to replace your Google Search Appliance (GSA)?&quot; on May 12, 2016 from 10 to 11 a.m. CEST. Please note that the webcast will be in German.

Text mining happens locally at the document, page, paragraph or sentence level.   Text mining is the analysis of unstructured texts, which is based on the application of statistical and linguistic methods. The objective of text analysis is the recognition of topics and core messages, which can enable the user to quickly analyze a text and to find the most important information at a glance.   Often the term clustering is used in connection with text mining - texts are grouped according to their contextual similarity and combined into so-called clusters. A simple practical example is a possible cluster for the term &quot;Mars&quot; - depending on whether you are talking about a chocolate bar or the planet Mars.  </body></Document><Document><url>https://www.intrafind.de/company/glossary/information-retrieval</url><id>785EC534CE9CF7DDD1C931BA9E2E680D</id><title>Information Retrieval</title><language>en</language><body>Information Retrieval   This area deals with the IT-supported gathering of information, this means finding existing content.  </body></Document><Document><url>https://www.intrafind.de/blog_en/the-difference-between-stemming-and-lemmatization-380</url><id>FD0BEB215788E01995A9D3396CFF6D36</id><title>The difference between stemming and lemmatization</title><language>en</language><body>The difference between stemming and lemmatization   &quot;Stemming&quot; as well as &quot;Lemmatization&quot; are commonly used buzzwords in the field of Information Retrieval (IR), particularly in the development of powerful search engines.   The inverted index Just as a quick reminder: The basis of a search engine is an index, called Inverted Index, a data structure which consists of a list of all unique words (index terms) occurring in any document of a document silo. Additionally, for each unique term a list of documents, in which the term appears, is saved.   As an example, let&apos;s assume that we have to index two documents: First document (doc1): In my house lives a mouse. Second document (doc2): Mice are living in my houses.   The (lowercased) inverted index will look like this: index term documents in doc1, doc2 my doc1, doc2 house doc1 lives doc1 a doc1 mouse doc1 mice doc2 are doc2 living doc2 houses doc2   Now imagine the search query &quot;mouse&quot; (on the above index). It will end up only in the first document as a search result, although document two is also an expected result candidate, as it contains &quot;mice&quot;, the plural of mouse.   A search engine of high quality must be able to handle those linguistical variations of index and search terms. Consequently, some kind of term normalization is indispensable. Stemming and lemmatization are both natural language processing techniques to make sure that different word variants (inflectional and derivational word forms) are not left out.   So what exactly is the difference between these two methods? What are the advantages and disadvantages and which one should be preferred?   Stemming vs. lemmatization   Stemming is a procedure to strip inflectional and derivational suffixes from index and search terms with the aim to merge different word forms into one canonical form, called stem or root. The most common stemmer is the Porter Stemmer (a Porter stemmer implementation is also provided by Lucene library), which works by heuristically (rule based) identifying word suffixes and then chopping them off.   By contrast, lemmatization means reducing an inflectional or derivationally related word form to its baseform (dictionary form) by applying a lookup in a word lexicon. More exactly, the mentioned word lexicon is a dictionary which covers a complete morphological analysis for each word of a specific language.   Advantages of a stemmer are that there are freely available implementations and that there is no need of lexicons, which have to be maintained. However, the quality of stemming often is bad.   Just have a look at some examples produced by Porter Stemmer: Whereas for example &quot;organization&quot; as well as &quot;organs&quot; are both stemmed to &quot;organ&quot; (over-stemming - stemmer is cutting off too much with the result that words of different meaning are reduced to the same root), the following two terms of same origin &quot;absorption&quot; and &quot;absorbing&quot; are stemmed to &quot;absorpt&quot; and &quot;absorb&quot; (under-stemming). There are many other examples where stemming algorithms fail, especially words of irregular inflection (foot [singl.] - feet [pl.], go [inf.] - went [past tense], ...). The problem concerning a search index is obvious - query &quot;organization&quot; will correctly match documents containing &quot;organization&quot; or &quot;organizations&quot;, but will also erroneously merge documents containing &quot;organs&quot;.   By contrast, if an efficient and sufficiently complete lexicon exists, a lemmatizer will mostly output correct baseforms. Thus, a search engine based on a lemmatization normalization component compared to a stemming component significantly benefits and provides much more accurate search results.   High recall and precision for enterprise search   In order to guarantee high recall and precision of iFinder&apos;s search results, IntraFind developed its own linguistic module called LISA, including a lemmatizer of high quality. LISA offers a complete morphological analysis by using complex prepared dictionaries of currently 15 European languages (Croatian, Czech, Dutch, English, French, German, Greek, Hungarian, Italian, Polish, Portuguese, Russian, Slovakian, Slovenian, Spanish).   Apart from lemmatization LISA is also a word decomposer, which is capable of splitting compound words in their individual word fragments. Imagine for example an English search query like &quot;toothpaste&quot;. Thanks to LISA you will be able to find documents, which contain of course &quot;toothpaste&quot;, as well as &quot;paste&quot; and &quot;tooth&quot;.   As German is a language much more complex than English, the following example is more exciting: The German search query &quot;Glückskeks&quot; decomposed by LISA results in two word parts - &quot;glück&quot; and &quot;keks&quot;. As you can see, LISA even succeeds in recognizing the semantic useless part of the word (&quot;s&quot;), called epenthesis (in German &quot;Fugenelement&quot;) and therefore the query will provide result documents containing &quot;glückskeks&quot;, &quot;glück&quot; and &quot;keks&quot;.   For enterprise search, using high performance linguistics like LISA means that the user gets highly relevant search results and no information is lost.   The Author Ursula Seisenberger, IntraFind Software AG, studied Computational Linguistics at the University of Munich (Center for Information and Language Processing). Since 2013 she works as a software architect at IntraFind with a special interest in text analytics methods.</body></Document><Document><url>https://www.intrafind.de/company/glossary/enterprise-search</url><id>4FDCAA05BCF4065DF301AE4F87DB4F6F</id><title>Enterprise Search</title><language>en</language><body>Enterprise Search   Company-wide search in unstructured and structured data, which can be stored in a variety of different applications and systems (SAP, Microsoft Exchange, SharePoint, DMS, CMS, etc.) .

However, this is usually 1: 1 based on the words that are known to the autocomplete function (e.g. existing product names). But how many users want to spend a lot of time to research the correct spelling of product or brand names?     Now that the searcher has typed countless spelling variants, searched and maybe hasn’t “found” the right product, he cancels the search and leaves the website. A loss for any company, which invested time and budget in sites, web shops and intensive advertising campaigns trying to reach customers.     &gt;&gt; Test the autocomplete product in our Live Demo Autocomplete For Online Shops In the world of online shopping a well-run, in other words a well-structured web shop with fast-find products are essential for a successful shopping experience. Providers of such shopping portals need to have highly intelligent mechanisms for a product search or product research. Web shop providers often offer their customers intelligent filtering mechanisms that accompany the user through the product range and they hope that the customer returns soon after a positive shopping experience. But what happens when a customer is looking for a particular product or a particular brand and does not know the exact spelling of the product?    An internal analysis by IntraFind of smaller and larger web shops or shopping portals has revealed that many stores show weakness at this point. Brands or products with spelling mistakes are not recognized by the existing autocomplete functionality. Often, the user needs to enter the exact spelling of a product in order to get further suggestions in autocomplete or in the hit list. After several attempts the non-finding of a product ultimately leads to a disappointing shopping experience, and in the worst case to a web page jump.    IntraFind can intelligently support at this point. Because even when you enter only a few letters, autocomplete starts and corrects spelling mistakes and suggests alternative terms. At a glance the customer sees the product or the brand, confirms the term and receives the desired product in the hit list as a result. Web shop providers benefit organizationally for instance in the international area. With simple mechanisms, the customer only sees the products available in his country. Products not relevant for the country are not displayed in autocomplete.  Autocomplete For Company Websites Especially corporate websites with many subpages are often hardly detected by third parties such as the customer. The customer will be supported with a well-designed navigation or filtering mechanisms. If the range of products exceeds the ability of these mechanisms, a good search engine is helpful.   The Autocomplete Service of IntraFind intelligently supports the customer when he enters his search term by automatically detecting spelling mistakes, tolerating errors, suggesting synonyms or related words. The customer no longer needs to know exactly how the manufacturer spells the product. Autocomplete also recognizes the right word “kaleidoscope” when spelling &quot;kaleiduscope&quot;.    The advantage: The customer can find the product quickly and easily.</body></Document><Document><url>https://www.intrafind.de/company/history</url><id>BE7E2342BD4D227A78132CABA4117F5E</id><title>Company history of IntraFind Software AG</title><language>en</language><body>History 2015 August Hamburg-based bakery Harry-Brot relies on IntraFind and opts for the use of Enterprise Search product iFinder.   June IntraFind hosts &quot;Enterprise Search &amp; Content Analytics Day&quot; on June 17, 2015 in Munich with 50 interested participants.

That&apos;s a smug innuendo. From my experience, developers are always on the lookout for beautiful solutions, of which numbers are but a symptom. The usage of approximative data structures for language processing is one such example of a beautiful idea with nice numbers.   When dealing with natural language we&apos;re often confronted with the need of storing and retrieving language statistics, as e.g. n-Gram distributions, word counts, document frequency counts, etc. Inherent to the discrete nature of language, most of these statistics fall into a key-value schema, i.e. for a particular key (say, a word) we want to know a number. Let&apos;s focus on one particularly well known statistics, the document frequency (DF). The DF of a word is the number of documents in a corpus in which this word appears. The DF is used in the computation of the TFIDF, a simple yet proven heuristic for determining relevance.   To put things into perspective, the English Wikipedia has around 7Mio articles and the same order of magnitude of distinct words. If we were to use a hash map for storing the DFs, we would need approximately 100MB of memory just to store the words and counters (add at least another 100MB for data structure overhead). Thats for one language and one kind of statistics. One way to achieve lower memory requirements is to abdicate precision. This is a small price to pay, since we&apos;re dealing with corpus statistics, an intrinsically noisy affair.   Count-Min Sketch [C&amp;M 2005] is a sub-linear space data structure for computing approximate frequencies. It allows us to trade-off exactitude for memory. By tuning its two only parameters ( ϵ and δ ) we can answer the question of how many times we have seen a word within ϵ ⋅ | w | (where | w | is the number of distinct words in a corpus) of the actual value with probability δ . The memory needed for this will be proportional to 1 ϵ ⋅ - log 2 ( 1 - δ ) . Count-Min Sketches (CMS) share some similarities with bloom filters by using pairwise independent hash functions and sharing memory among keys. Figure 1 A CMS holds a two dimensional array of counters. The depth of the array determines the confidence probability ( δ ) and also the amount of hash functions we will use. The width determines the mean error we accept for count estimates. The two operations defined on a CMS are: add(key, value) and estimate(key). On add(key, value) we add value to the counters in the buckets corresponding to the computed hash values for each row using the independent hash functions (fig. 1). On estimate(key) we return the minimum value out of all corresponding buckets (fig. 2). As a side note: an easy improvement on the error expectation in detriment of a little runtime overhead is to change add(key, value) to only update the minimal buckets. Figure 2 One easy observation is that a CMS suffers under saturation, meaning that the precision guarantees depend on the number of distinct entries (words in our case); i.e. the more distinct words are added, the larger the chance of hash collisions distorting the counts. In a CMS errors are always positive, since there is no operation decreasing counter values. Yet another observation is that the errors have bigger impact on rare entries. Following the latter observation, CMS errors have a smoothing effect on word counts, which in NLP is something often required. As a cherry on the cake: CMSs have associative properties and can be elegantly distributed.   At IntraFind we have been using CMSs and other approximation techniques (e.g. sampling) in a few nlp applications with great success. We see approximative data structures as a vital technology block in a big data realm. At the present moment we are working on a novel approximative data structure, which we call a converging map, to store mappings from normal forms of terms or term compounds to their most frequent surface form appearing in a corpus, without the need of storing neither the normal forms nor the less frequent surface forms.     Bibliography: [C&amp;M 2005]: Cormode, G., &amp; Muthukrishnan, S.
