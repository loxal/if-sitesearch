<h1>Pricing</h1>

<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Freemium</strong>, 1,000 search requests per month are ðŸ¦„<strong>free</strong>
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Enterprise</strong>, every 100 requests on top of the <strong>Freemium</strong> offer, cost 10 â‚¬
    </li>
</ul>

<p>
    Payment happens lazily. Once the Freemium quota is exceeded, the user receives a PayPal e-mail, to grant IntraFind
    rights to charge him.
    When the user does not react within 2 workdays, search queries are blocked.
