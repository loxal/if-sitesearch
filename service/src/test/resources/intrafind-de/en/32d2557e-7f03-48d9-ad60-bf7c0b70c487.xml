This project is funded in the context of the support program KMU-innovativ of the Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF).   Compared to OntoVigilance, in the OntoPMS project more documents and risk-specific data sources should be included. Also the Federal Institute for Drugs and Medical Devices (BfArM) has joined the project as additional partner.   In this project IntraFind will be working on an ontology-based process for relation and event extraction. In particular, the concept of Ontology Search will be developed, with which the domain-dependent and ontology-based share of information extraction is mainly carried out on complex new search operators on a linguistically enriched full-text index. This approach has the advantage that it can respond much more flexible to changes in the ontology.  Completed Research Projects: Research project Ontovigilance - improvement of medical devices As part of the funding innovative KMU-innovativ of the Federal Ministry of Education and Research, IntraFind could win the research project Ontovigilance (Start: March 1, 2013 Project duration: two years).   The goal of the project is to develop an ontology-based vigilance software for efficient evaluation of scientific publications and reports regarding the use of technical medical equipment. The deficiencies, complications and risks associated with the devices described in the texts, are software-supported detected and extracted. On this basis, the system developed in the project will provide a decision support for the optimization of medical devices.   Compared to manual handling of support cases the support by software-based methods helps manufacturers of technical medical equipment to detect and respond early to product defects. This saves valuable time and money in product development and represents a competitive advantage.   For this purpose IntraFind develops these ontology-based search and information extraction methods in close cooperation with the Institute for Medical Computer Science, Statistics and Epidemiology at the University of Leipzig and the companies Novineon and MT2IT. Employed are the IntraFind products Tagging Service and NAMER (entity recognition) based on a SOA architecture, for generating ontologies and metadata from the provided medical documentation (target languages: German, English). Social CRM Intelligence The succesfully completed research project SCRM-I dealt with the development of innovative services for the expansion of existing CRM software including semantic text mining. The services should simplify the identification of messages, requests, trends, opinions and developments, and support businesses in the interaction with the social web. Thus, the Social CRM gives an insight into how companies, brands and products are evaluated by consumers on public social media platforms. IntraFind contributed their long-standing know-how in the area of text analysis in the cooperation with the Universities of Leipzig and Hohenheim. Who was the inventor of the espresso machine? Ask questions - get answers In the research project NL-Search (KMU-innovativ / ICT) a search engine that is able to answer natural language questions in real time was developed during a two years project with the University of Saarland. Instead of entering keywords, as in popular search engines, the user can ask simple questions in natural language. The search results are not complete documents but short passages or phrases, containing an answer to the question asked. Basis of the search engine is the IntraFind Enterprise Search product iFinder. An important point for business decisions is that one always has an ear for scientific advancements outside the market economy. What happens at the university level, what are the topics that develop students and professors together today? In order not to miss these impulses IntraFind involved from the outset, a team of scientists actively support the research projects.</body></Document><Document><url>https://www.intrafind.de/company/management</url><id>0F7FC24C841E22FFCC27C2E5CDC00FD6</id><title>Executive management and supervisory board of IntraFind Software AG</title><language>en</language><body>Executive Management</body></Document><Document><url>https://www.intrafind.de/services/support_consulting</url><id>2A5CBB078AA5016FC3CF833F8344AE59</id><title>Support &amp; Consulting Services</title><language>en</language><body>Support &amp; Consulting Services   IntraFind offers support and consulting services in the strategic conception and implementation of Enterprise Search projects and follows a practice-related, holistic approach under the early consideration of possible technical and organizational factors, which could endanger the success of the project for a long time.   If an Enterprise Search project is already in a critical phase and a failure is imminent, customers can also count on the expertise of the experienced IntraFind project leaders, who will stand by their side and work together with them on solutions.   In addition, IntraFinds know-how lies in planning and execution of big data projects.

The right information at the right time can bring a competitive edge and be decisive for economic success.   The search for appropriate solutions and tools for dealing with large amounts of data has long been the concern of IT managers in companies - the topic &quot;Big Data&quot; is on everyone’s lips. Recent studies show that especially unstructured data contain important information that has to be analyzed, used and be made available for further processing for employees or systems such as Business Intelligence (BI).   But what are &quot;Big Data&quot; actually?   Many years of practical experience show that &quot;Big Data&quot; start where companies lose oneself in the variety of applications, systems and file storage structures, in short, where they cannot find anything anymore. Thus, the topic &quot;Big Data&quot; not only concerns big enterprises but also medium and small sized companies; however, solutions for this do not need to be expensive, time-consuming and complex.   Using a company-wide search solution (Enterprise Search) can help enormously to break information silos containing location or department specific information and allow all employees a fast and user-friendly access to the information they need.   Not only classic enterprise search scenarios, but also the analysis of log files, measurement and sensor data, real-time data and classical business intelligence data combined with structured, semi-structured and unstructured information form the spectrum of our projects in the Big Data environment.  </body></Document><Document><url>https://www.intrafind.de/contact-form</url><id>A5873503DFEBDA67AD85B507D5D0B969</id><title>IntraFind Contact</title><language>en</language><body>IntraFind Contact Form</body></Document><Document><url>https://www.intrafind.de/products/ifinder5-elastic/innovation-at-a-glance</url><id>3284A4BBC1AFDB5E9C0F1390E945BB9C</id><title>iFinder5 elastic - Innovation at a Glance</title><language>en</language><body>iFinder5 elastic - The most important innovations at a glance.

For instance, companies that are already using an Enterprise Search solution can use high quality filters or can better evaluate document contents. In addition, uniformly tagged documents and editorial content can be found much better.   The IntraFind Tagging Service consists of different, standardized, but also configurable tagging types:   Free statistic tagging Controlled, statistic and rule based tagging Entity extraction Text classification Automatic instead of laborious manual tagging Tagging Service automatically identifies semantic descriptors (keywords, entities, subjects) from documents and additionally delivers a contextual view of the document. The extracted semantic descriptors can then be integrated in applications or in the company wide search or can even trigger further process chains. Tagging Service serves the content related extraction of information or the tagging of unstructured text.   In connection with a company wide search or with the Enterprise CMS, these semantic descriptors form a knowledge base of the entire document inventory and allow for, among other things, a semantic search in company data or the automatic tagging of documents. Tagging Service can be operated as software-as-a-service (SaaS), this means it runs as an independent service either on the local server of the customer or also on a remote server and provides all important functions through web services.   The output can, for example, be integrated in any usage context at the customer’s location as a Word or Explorer plug-in, in order to generate tagging suggestions for a created text or in order to act as a back-end component for the analysis, tagging and enrichment of mass data (e.g. files on file servers) with metadata. Text to Web to Tag - a Web Service Depending on the desired return format, different web services are available for the extraction of semantic descriptors (keywords, subjects, entities) from an unstructured text.   With HTML and XML, two return formats are currently supported. The HTML return lists the results of the information extraction in a table and is intended for demonstration and test purposes. Of course, a customer specific format - even with a different HTML format - can be defined and integrated readily. The XML format offers the possibility to use the extraction results further through a program, for example, through Microsoft SharePoint plug-ins or via Ajax in a website.   Tagging Service is linearly scalable and is therefore also suitable for large data quantities. IntraFind tagging service: generate metadata - successfully find information   Metadata is by definition data that describes texts or a collection of data and documents. Intelligently structured, they reflect the content of a document, like the author, date of creation, location of creation, person responsible, but also the text modules, which are particularly relevant so that a contextual overview of an individual document is provided without a laborious viewing. Furthermore, such metadata can be combined across documents and thereby ensure important insight into the company data. In companies, the structure of metadata is either not available as a process level or often a manual process; journalists index their new article, employees contents, which they upload into a SharePoint infrastructure. Thus metadata also ensures that, for example, employees provide information in a comprehensively retrievable manner. But does this work through a manual process? IntraFind sees a big risk here, because particularly manual metadata creation is often susceptible to errors, because it is done by humans and therefore subjective. Each of us has a different view on what is really important in a text and thereby indexes according to the best of one’s knowledge. The colleague from the same team in contrast evaluates the contents completely differently and therefore indexes this differently. In this case, the person searching for information suffers because he/she does not receive the desired document and has to spend a lot more time and patience while searching and finding contents. IntraFind offers a comprehensive solution with Tagging Service. Fully automatic metadata enrichment for Microsoft SharePoint instances, file systems, DMS or archiving systems are only a few possible integration options. Other application examples: The metadata created with Tagging Service can be used for the following purposes:   Enrichment of information Improvement of the search Classification tasks Control of workflows Identification compliance-relevant data or Identification of documents, which are to be transferred to a DMS or archive for audit reasons.</body></Document><Document><url>https://www.intrafind.de/solutions/search-in-plm-pdm-systems</url><id>AF745884EC3397F499EFB88411CEDA73</id><title>Search in PLM &amp; PDM Systems</title><language>en</language><body>Benefits of an intelligent search in PLM/PDM Systems Efficient search in product data and technical documentation   Due to the increasing dynamics and complexity of product development and manufacturing, linking and rapid provision of product data as well as new concepts for product data management are increasingly necessary, especially for core industries such as the automotive and manufacturing industry.   Indeed, many companies do have IT tools for specific product data management systems for storing and managing product data and technical documentation, but the information contained needs to be used efficiently and made accessible to different target groups.   Challenges in product data management When managing their product data and technical information many companies face the following challenges:   No standardized processes for the collection of product-related information: The information collection and provision are often not sufficiently defined or standardized - this hampers the research processes. Later, important information is difficult or even no longer retrievable. Lack of completeness: Not all product-relevant data are processed in the PDM system - for a holistic view of the life cycle of a product, information must be drawn from other data sources. Complicated handling: The use of PDM systems requires a lot of know-how and in the context of information retrieval, knowledge of system-specific query mechanisms. Consequently, working with PDM systems is time-consuming even for routine research, the training of new employees is difficult. Emergence of information silos: Departments and special divisions often use their own filing systems and develop individual structures. This supports the emergence of information silos, knowledge gaps of employees and avoidable additional expenses in the information creation - when a document already exists in the company, but it cannot be found, it often is created anew. Limitited access to information: In addition, PDM systems are almost never accessible to all internal departments and employees in the company, although in practice almost every employee needs product data in their everyday work – from their department’s or special division’s perspective. Deficient research support for users: The possibilities of an internal PDM-search are limited to the system itself and provide only rudimentary support for the user. On this account, employees which use the system infrequently and therefore have no routine tend to avoid using it. The use of search across applications in connection with PDM systems provides many benefits for organizations and users Completeness of product-related information: The connection of additional data sources to the PDM-Search allows the user to gain a holistic view on a topic or issue. The search will then, for example, in addition to standards, provide test reports and technical documents as well as product-related e-mails and other information from the file system. Improved usability: The user is familiar with search interfaces from the internet. They provide an intuitive access to needed information, without requiring a deeper system know-how of the underlying data sources. Mechanisms like auto-complete, suggestion of synonyms, cross-lingual search or the use of search filters offer the user valuable assistance. Knowledge Maps also allow untrained and infrequent users an intuitive access to information. This way, research processes can be implemented conveniently and efficiently, system-related barriers are reduced and information is accessible user-friendly and ACL checked. Higher quality in the hit list: The search in the context of PDM systems is usually limited to a simple full-text search. The use of powerful enterprise search products such as iFinder allows to influence the ranking of search results (e.g., an important norm or a current test report is always displayed at the top of the hit list), but also the addition of components for Linguistics, Semantic-associative Search or Cross-lingual Search. These not only provide a higher completeness and precision of the search results, but also allow a simultaneous search in documents in foreign languages. Development of new user groups: A search beyond the PDM system also offers the opportunity to provide product data for all areas and departments of a company and to use them in all business processes. This also allows development and construction distant departments such as quality management, marketing and buying department access to product data without having to use a PDM client.</body></Document><Document><url>https://www.intrafind.de/index_en</url><id>7EE25AFE7BC1CE3D33507A008D60C4CF</id><title>IntraFind Software AG - Enterprise Search, Tagging, Text Analytics</title><language>en</language><body>EVENTS November 13, 2017: Meet IntraFind at NetApp Insight 2017 in Berlin Get to know more &gt; NEWS July 26, 2017: &quot;Cognitive Search: How AI and Machine Learning are driving Enterprise Search Solutions&quot; Whitepaper for Download &gt; CAREER If you are as passionate and enthusiastic about ENTERPRISE SEARCH &amp; CONTENT ANALYTICS as we are Join our team &gt;</body></Document><Document><url>https://www.intrafind.de/products/elasticsearch/services-plugins</url><id>32D6AE77AC23646AE44395E006DB688C</id><title>IntraFind Services&amp;Plugins</title><language>en</language><body>Services &amp; Plug-Ins for Elasticsearch   With the growing volume of unstructured data, companies face new challenges in handling documents and information. With its Services &amp; Plug-Ins IntraFind expands the leading open source search server Elasticsearch and offers companies simplicity and maximum flexibility for the implementation of high performance and scalable web applications, particularly in the field of Big Data.   This has important advantages: With the IntraFind Services &amp; Plug-Ins, Elasticsearch will be faster and easier to use. Project durations and costs reduce significantly by the quick and easy integrable IntraFind Services &amp; Plug-Ins. In addition, the modular system perfectly complements the range of functions, which is necessary for the implementation of a search application.   Services &amp; Plug-Ins (e.g. for document conversion, results preview, autocomplete, linguistics, tagging with metadata and for the integration of external resources such as thesauri) ensure high quality of the search results and thus for usability. The IntraFind Services &amp; Plug-Ins are available as cloud services (SaaS) or as an on-premise solution. In addition, they are usable single or combined flexibly.   The following features characterize the IntraFind Services: Users can implement and use the services in little time and with little prior knowledge All services are slim, performance optimized and easy to integrate Web interface in XML, JSON, Hessian- and SOAP-format Availability of load balancing and fault tolerance Minimum installation requirements Good abstraction of search technology implementation Migration to future technologies without client-side changes   IntraFind Services Search &amp; Index Service Extract Service Preview &amp; Extract Service Autocomplete Service Tagging Service Query Expansion Service SimFinder Service Summarizer Service IntraFind Plugins Linguistik Plugin  </body></Document><Document><url>https://www.intrafind.de/company/glossary/metadata</url><id>AA9A51300C20ACED9E832390566D3DF8</id><title>Metadata</title><language>en</language><body>Metadata   Metadata such as names of people, locations, companies or products mentioned are the building blocks of content of text and can be used in a wide variety of business processes in order to improve the handling of information, for example as filter criteria for enterprise-wide search for documents.   In business metadata are often created and inserted manually into the document properties. Typical metadata of a document are, for example, the author&apos;s name, the document language, creation and modification date, file type or file size. The manual assignment of metadata (in this context also known as keywords or tags) follows the subjective criteria of the author and is therefore prone to failure.   The objective is to simplify, standardize and ultimately automate the metadata generation process through intelligent methods or products.   Automatic metadata generation provides many advantages - uniform, standardized metadata can be used directly for indexing and allow safe retrieval of documents or intelligent linking of information.  </body></Document><Document><url>https://www.intrafind.de/company/glossary/sdk</url><id>B2FC037B2BFED610B3FEBB607F6F9962</id><title>SDK</title><language>en</language><body>SDK   Software Development Kit - IntraFind provides the iFinder SDK in Java or .Net so that it can be expanded or integrated into existing infrastructures.  </body></Document><Document><url>https://www.intrafind.de/products/elasticsearch/services-plugins/tagging-service</url><id>72D2B5F8BADB126036CA4AD4C668BA45</id><title>Tagging Service</title><language>en</language><body>Tagging Service The Tagging Service extracts metadata (tags) from unstructured texts and recognizes the associated entities such as people, places and topics.

Although this is a relatively young technology compared to the Apache projects Lucene and Solr, the popularity of Elasticsearch is growing worldwide and it is increasingly employed as an alternative to Solr. Currently, the application is downloaded by more than 300,000 customers and users each month.   The strength of Elasticsearch is the distributed search, the great flexibility, scalability, and high availability of the system as well as in dealing with large amounts of data („Big Data“). In connection with Elasticsearch, developers even speak of &quot;real-time search&quot;, because changes to the system or to the indexed data set linked to the search, affect the search results very quickly.   Consequently, Elasticsearch is particularly suitable as a base search technology for corporations and businesses that already have very large data sets, which record a very high growth of their data or their data underlies many changes (e.g. adjustments in the rights and role structure, adding and deleting documents).   IntraFind uses this basic technology as a powerful engine for further development into a separate product; this includes a user-friendly search interface, tools for the administration and monitoring of the system as well as the service level, which allow a permanent stable operation of the solution in the company.   IntraFind offers the following services for Elasticsearch: Services &amp; Plugins for Elasticsearch With the integration of IntraFind plugins in an Elasticsearch environment and the use of IntraFind services based on Elasticsearch, the range of functions and the quality of search results increases.   Search &amp; Index Service: supports the search and indexig process based on Elasticsearch Extract Service: extraction of text information from documents (available for more than 600 file formats) Preview &amp; Extract Service: in addition to text extraction generation of previews and thumbnail images for a quick document preview Autocomplete Basic Service: autocomplete when typing in search terms Autocomplete Premium Service: autocomplete when typing in search terms including intelligent automatic correction as well as check of access rights.

Based on previous knowledge and their ability of interpretation people can determine semantic context from contents very well and can interpret the actual information correctly. In order to find relevant information, the context sensitive interpretation of content is often crucial. Classic Enterprise Search and Information Retrieval solutions reach their limits here. Text classification is a key technology in order to determine the topics and contexts of documents beyond the word level and to make them usable. In order to determine the topics, it is not the individual words which are used, but rather automatically generated sets of words and multi-word terms.   Thus, for example, keywords for documents can be determined and topic pages can be automatically compiled for publishers and libraries. A document can, for example, be assigned to the topic of &quot;foreign politics&quot; without the word &quot;foreign politics&quot; occurring explicitly in the document text. The basis for the assignment can be terms like &quot;State Department&quot;, &quot;Embassies&quot; or also names of foreign affairs politicians. Time is money: Mail and email forwarding, spam filtering The quantity of incoming mail and emails that has to be dealt with by employees is very large and constantly growing. The TopicFinder can significantly reduce this time and cost intensive activity by automatically marking or filtering a spam document and forwarding customer requests automatically to the expert or departments that are most appropriate for the topic.   In order to be able to fulfill this task, TopicFinder must be specifically trained for the information needs of the customer. The use of TopicFinder is divided into a training phase and a productive phase. An administrative web application for training and evaluation is available for this. Multi-threading guarantees efficient training, scalable to large data quantities and complex taxonomies. Smart - TopicFinder filters messages or generates newsletters automatically TopicFinder automatically assigns documents to topics based on single-level or multi-level hierarchical taxonomies. Thus, for example, messages from news tickers can be forwarded, depending on the content, to the sports, politics or economics departments or an indexing of news articles can be executed on the basis of a topical hierarchy.   For a weekly newsletter, technical articles can be filtered on the basis of a predefined newsletter profile and ordered according to relevance. TopicFinder analyzes all articles, sorts them according to significance and groups similar articles or even duplicates together in order to simplify the further processing and keep the flood of information as low as possible.</body></Document><Document><url>https://www.intrafind.de/company/glossary/stakeholder</url><id>7DD3025D01F556537E1AA46AA5646112</id><title>Stakeholder</title><language>en</language><body>Stakeholder   a person or group that has a legitimate interest in the course or result of a process or project  </body></Document><Document><url>https://www.intrafind.de/boolean-operators</url><id>7C2F8E861083B269C9A9F3405239D91A</id><title>Boolean operators</title><language>en</language><body>Boolean operators   Boolean operators are combinations or expressions such as AND (conjunction), OR (disjunction), NOT (negation) and XOR (exclusive OR).

It is either done methodically by the team, which in advance agreed on a uniform filing structure or less methodically without any specifications, but personal folders. One result of both methods is that each department generates information silos from its file system.  Loosen up these information silos with IntraFind. The iFinder5 elastic, linked to a file system, releases each department from folder structure or file storage. With our search solution teams have ad hoc access to stored information.   The best: The iFinder5 elastic provides the user not only with the searched document or file (PowerPoint slides, Excel spreadsheets, PDFs, etc.), but also with additional thematically relevant documents, which contents can be used for your work.  Of course, the data source &quot;file system&quot; is just one of many.
