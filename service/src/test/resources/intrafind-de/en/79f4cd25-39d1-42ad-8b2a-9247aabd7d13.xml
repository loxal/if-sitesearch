The tagging service automatically delivers high quality keywords and topical suggestions according to objective measures from the created editorial content. The editor can accept these suggestions, for example, for a link of his/her article to the content portal or he/she can make manual changes and amendments themselves.   The elimination of extensive manual routine work means a valuable relief and saved time for editors. Moreover, the editorial contents are easier to reuse and be used on the portals through an optimal context-based linking.   With the help of the tagging service, for example, the entire ZEIT archive was uniformly automatically indexed and the 400,000 articles were linked in a meaningful and user-friendly manner. Improvement of the search quality in content portals Through the integration of the linguistic component LISA into the IntraFind iFinder or in an existing Solr-based search solution, the quality of hits in content portals can be improved significantly. Powerful technologies dissect and analyze the search query of the portal visitor in the background and deliver a clear and complete hit list, independent of capitalization, typos or a difference between the singular and plural form of the search term.   A quick and uncomplicated way to the desired hit list results as an added value for the users, through which their motivation to visit the portal more frequently and to dwell on the websites for a longer time is increased. Increase of user-friendliness for portal visitors For companies of the media and publishing sectors, it is essential to gear their online offers optimally to the customer needs. Long dwell times, a large selection of visited pages and high click numbers of the portal visitors are important indicators for the determination of advertisement prices. Simultaneously, in addition to the journalistic quality, the user-friendly presentation of the content provides for a more frequent usage and a longer-term binding to the medium.   The IntraFind Enterprise Search product iFinder supports portal visitors in the targeted search through a clear interface and functionalities like the auto-complete or typo correction during the entry of the term itself. With an automatic linking of the article and the context-dependent display of further information, the portal visitors are additionally encouraged to look through the contents and stay on the portal for a longer period of time.   Modern technologies support media and publishers in the digital age.   In the digital age, the media and publishing sector is confronted with numerous challenges. New technologies such as high-speed internet connections, smartphones and tablet PCs allow for comprehensive, fast and mobile access to larger and larger quantities of information, which also leads to a changed user behavior. The customers expect communication in real time under the inclusion of all digital channels and a simple and precise access to the desired information. For journalists, due to the transition from printed media to online media, there is an even stronger requirement to prepare large quantities of information in an understandable manner and to network contents together meaningfully. For media and publishing companies, this means the development of new payment models far from the classic print subscriptions and advertisement prices. Furthermore, takeovers, mergers and bankruptcy of media and publishing companies and the closure of established printed media such as the &quot;Frankfurter Rundschau&quot; and &quot;Financial Times Germany&quot; newspapers result in an even stronger concentration of the market, a further increase in competition and increasing cost pressure in the companies. IntraFind developed special solutions for employees and companies of the media and publishing sector for the efficient preparation and linking of text information and supports their investigation process with powerful search technologies such as the iFinder. Renowned companies such as ZEIT ONLINE and Wolters Kluwer Deutschland obtain high quality results with a simultaneous saving in time and costs through the usage of IntraFind technologies.  </body></Document><Document><url>https://www.intrafind.de/company/glossary/entity</url><id>35B0EDCD9D207DEC873793875A1796D4</id><title>Entity</title><language>en</language><body>Entity   Definitions, word origin, synonyms, translations  </body></Document><Document><url>https://www.intrafind.de/company/glossary/algorithm</url><id>4F458F197DA9F60720D3212E52A6C2BA</id><title>Algorithm</title><language>en</language><body>Algorithm   Algorithms for computers are now as diverse as the applications they are supposed to enable. From electronic control devices for use in vehicles to the spelling and sentence structure checking in a text processing program up to the analysis of stock markets - thousands of more or less capable algorithms are used. As ideas and principles that a computer program is based on, algorithms are normally not given copyright protection. Depending on the national state of the intellectual property rights, algorithms of computer sciences may be patent protected so that copyright free individual works, as a result of mental creation, can still not always be used free of charge. This affects or affected, for example, algorithms that are based on the mathematics of the Hough transformation (decades old, but often updated concept with new registration), programs that wanted to read and write the GIF image format or also programs in the area of audio and video processing, because the respective algorithms, as implemented in the relevant codecs, are often not freely available. The corresponding potentials for saving for all users worldwide (1 million USD was reported on DEC XCON once for the Rete algorithm) should exceed the threshold of one billion USD a year umpteen times without problem.

That’s right, we have always seen it this way.</title><language>en</language><body>Hardware was yesterday? That’s right, we have always seen it this way. Google discontinues Google Search Appliance (GSA). Google recently announced to its Gold Partners that from 2017 on they no longer want to sell their Google Search Appliance, a hardware-software bundle that has been on the market since 2002. The reason they give is that all the components and functionalities that Google currently provides their B2C users via www.google.com, no longer can be integrated into a single hardware. The user requirements have grown and everyone expects that the possibilities of the typical internet search, are also available in an enterprise search with GSA. Google wants to solve this problem worldwide with a cloud-based application for companies. What is it all about the Google Search Cloud? Our idea for this is as follows: Especially for the development of natural language search, as we know it from Apple&apos;s Siri, it is very useful for Google to analyze, evaluate and save various search patterns. From this they can derive “smart” and “salable” solutions. To drive this process, Google needs an enormous global information package from all business environments. In a classic B2C user’s area, Google as well as Facebook can access considerable knowledge, which contains search queries, content on web pages, display and use of hit lists, acceptance of organic rankings, click behavior or reading flow. This results in million profiles that are evaluated by statistical methods. The result is, for example, applications such as Google Translate, whose introduction and market acceptance made other companies disappear. For many users, this development is scary because it is intransparent and incalculable.   But is every company that has integrated GSA willing to store its company knowledge and information in the Cloud? And risk the worst case scenario that the search queries and search behavior of their employees are used for statistical analysis? To briefly address the hardware issue. Many enterprise search vendors followed and still follow Google’s trend and invest in inflexible hardware solutions which offer the customer only a very limited insight into the process. We at IntraFind also think that a black box is not the solution, because therewith scalability and performance have their limits. And we already know from our customers that they need a high level of individual programming and workarounds. So why would you replace a solution that is considered as no future solution by Google – namely a search appliance - with another copy?

The researcher worked on home care robotics for the elderly. I got interested and wanted to know more about it. The objective was to have a robot learn how to cook, clean a toilet and wash the dishes. All by itself. And: &quot;at some point a machine will be able to understand text and learn stuff from the internet, so we concentrate on what happens after that&quot;.       This struck me as a very bold assumption. Here is an analogy: thinking about what kind of special stretching exercises I should do once I beat Usain Bolt on the 100m sprint. I&apos;m not arguing that it&apos;s impossible (you don&apos;t know me!), and I won&apos;t deny the possibility of language understanding becoming a fact, but it was the hardest part in that system. And it got my attention.   Very soon I got my hands on a book on precisely this topic called &quot;Foundations of Statistical Natural Language Processing&quot; by Christopher Manning and Hinrich Schütze. It is a remarkably well written book, by authors that don&apos;t shy away from looking beyond the border of their field. The introductory chapter puts the approach of a quantitative, non-symbolic and non-logical Natural Language Processing (the authors&apos; definition of statistical NLP) into its historic and language-philosophical context.   In this post I want to revisit some aspects of this introduction and go a little deeper into what is only one short section on page 17, namely Ludwig Wittgenstein&apos;s argument of &quot;meaning is use&quot; (Philosophical Investigations, 1953), and how it can be seen as a philosophical justification for statistical NLP, including machine learning. Empirical arguments – the statistical modelling of language works The successful use of statistical models in language is naturally a killer argument for using these methods. Naive Bayes classifiers, Latent Dirichlet Allocation models, Support Vector Machines, Deep Neural Nets, Hidden Markov Models, have all achieved remarkable results on several NLP tasks in the last years. But how did this all begin?   The American linguist George K. Zipf was one of the first (early 20th century) to study statistical properties of language. He found out, that if one orders the words of a language according to their frequency – giving the most frequent word the rank 1, the second rank 2, etc. – the product of frequency * rank will remain approximately constant for all words. In other words, the most common word occurs approximately twice as often as the second most common word, and three times as often as the third most frequent word, and so on. This remarkable property of natural languages is called Zipf&apos;s Law. Several well-known best practices in statistical NLP go back to this discovery, e.g. ignoring words in stopword lists. These are lists of the most common words in a corpus that occur that often that they don&apos;t carry any statistical importance for a particular task. Zipf also discovered that there is a negative correlation between a word&apos;s length and its frequency as well as a positive correlation between age and frequency.   These simple, yet remarkable findings show that there is something intrinsically statistical in natural languages. It&apos;s not clear what explains these phenomena – maybe the principle of least effort that Zipf believes is a key characteristic of humans; maybe it&apos;s a greater mathematical law governing many things including language. But we shouldn&apos;t look for causality; it suffices to accept that these properties are measurable.   1948 an engineering breakthrough happened in the area of communication – the development of Information Theory by Claude Shannon. Shannon worked at the famous Bell Labs on communication systems and devised a mathematical theory of communication on noisy channels. He showed that regardless of the noise in a communication channel, it is possible to communicate error-free through it. This works up to a maximum bandwidth, defined by the actual bandwidth and the noise.     Information Theory provides the pillars for all modern communication systems and models communication as a stochastic process (a statistical model). Key concepts in Information Theory as &quot;Entropy&quot; or &quot;Mutual Information&quot; have been found to relate closely to and be useful in the processing of natural languages.   Information Theory provides, for example, the theoretical lower limit achievable by compressing a text in a particular language.   The language-philosophical argument – Wittgenstein and “meaning is use” All these empirical proofs showing that the statistical modeling of language is actually not a farfetched idea give us more or less quantitative assurance that these methods have their entitlement to exist. Wittgenstein provides us with what could be called a qualitative argument that is based on how he understands the inner workings of natural languages.   Wittgenstein argues that for a very large class of words there are no strictly definable meanings, in a mathematical sense. The question &quot;what is the meaning of areté?&quot;, for example, is a question one cannot answer in a satisfying way (ask Meno! [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meno]). This argument seems strange at first, since we&apos;re used to asking precisely this question – even more so when learning a new language. Wittgenstein claims that the meaning of a word is given by its use in the language.      From §43: &quot;Man kann für eine große Klasse von Fällen der Benützung des Wortes &quot;Bedeutung&quot; – wenn auch nicht für alle Fälle seiner Benützung – dieses Wort so erklären: Die Bedeutung eines Wortes ist sein Gebrauch in der Sprache.&quot;   Take as an example the German word &quot;Spiel&quot; (§66-§71), which is a noun very close to the English &quot;game&quot;, but is used to describe also leisure activities small children do, as playing with a ball, or playing catch, etc. If one is asked what the meaning of &quot;Spiel&quot; is, one idea could be to try and find one single common feature permeating all kinds of &quot;Spiel&quot;. But what would the single common feature be between a professional game of chess and the kicking of a ball against a garage door? Are they all entertaining? Think about the game of Russian roulette! Oh, maybe all &quot;Spiele&quot; have a winner and a loser? Who wins and who loses in a game of solitaire? Maybe it&apos;s all about agility? But compare the agility necessary in chess with the one needed in soccer; and what agility do you need for a game of Bingo? One will quickly realize that all &quot;Spiele&quot; are part of an incredibly complex web of relations, but I defy anyone to find one single common character shared by all &quot;Spiele&quot;.   Wittgenstein calls this &quot;Familienähnlichkeiten&quot; (family resemblances). As members of a family share several characteristics, e.g. expressions, height, eye color, or temper, but never all of them at once, words in a family also share several features. Another very nice analogy is that of a thread. The thread is composed of thousands of fibers that interleave, some touching each other, most not touching each other at all, being very distant from another – but together composing one single object we call a thread. &quot;Spiel&quot; is one such thread, composed of many fibers (instances of a &quot;Spiel&quot;), some sharing portions of what makes them a &quot;Spiel&quot;, some not.   The only way to explain the &quot;meaning&quot; of &quot;Spiel&quot; is to actually enumerate all known uses of &quot;Spiel&quot; in the language. One could say that &quot;Spiel&quot; has a fuzzy definition – but does this make the word useless? I believe not. I even do believe that this fuzziness is more informative and meaningful than if there was a clear definition of &quot;Spiel&quot;.   Of course, this exercise can be expanded to several other words. The first time I read these aphorisms, they resonated with my experiences and I was very quickly very much convinced by them (&quot;Yes! This is how I understand language!&quot;). The beauty of this idea is that it provides a very convincing philosophical theory that justifies the approach of collecting examples of text (corpora) and trying to learn patterns from them, which is the way statistical NLP and machine learning work. Furthermore, Wittgenstein&apos;s argument of &quot;meaning is use&quot; implies that there is no other way to understand a large part of language; this is one fundamental nature of language, and this is how humans understand and use it.   And this is a damned good argument for doing our job the way we do it.   The Author Breno Faria, Head of Development, joined IntraFind in 2012.
